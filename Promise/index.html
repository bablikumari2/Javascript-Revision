    <!-- Why do you need a promise
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks
 by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code. -->

 <!-- What are the three states of promise
Promises have three states:

Pending: This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
Fulfilled: This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
Rejected: This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown. -->
